# Industrial Copper Modeling

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict **Selling Price (Regression)** and **Status (Classification: WON/LOST)** for copper industry data.  
It features an interactive **Streamlit** application for predictions using pre-trained models.

---

## Features
- Regression model to predict `Selling Price`.
- Classification model to predict `Status` (WON/LOST).
- Input validation for numeric fields.
- Pre-trained encoders, scalers, and models loaded dynamically.
- Styled Streamlit UI for better user experience.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone Repository**
